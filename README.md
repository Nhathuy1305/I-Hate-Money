   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd I-Hate-Money
   ```
4. Change branches (We have 2 branches: `main` and `staging`)
   - The `main` branch is used for building on the production environment (Choose it if you want to deploy for
     public access, the current workflow is set up for Microsoft Azure based on `.github/workflows/main_i-hate-money.yml`)
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```
   - The `staging` branch is used for testing and debugging purposes (Choose it if you want to test the application, or
     hobby purposes)
   ```sh
   git checkout staging
   ```
5. Ensure you have Node.js installed by running node -v in your terminal. If you don't have Node.js, you can download
   and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
6. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
7. Edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` for personal use. You need to modify:
    ```
   server.port=
   spring.datasource.url=
   spring.datasource.username=
   spring.datasource.password=
   ```
   based on your local database configuration (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc).
8. Open the project in Intellij IDEA and run the `Application.java` file.
9. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8081` to access the app.

### Motivation

Imagine a world where individuals feel empowered and in control of their financial destinies, where budgeting becomes a

and empowers users, we have the opportunity to revolutionize the way people interact with their finances. With 
IHateMoney, users can effortlessly track their income, monitor expenses, and strategically plan their savings, all 
within a user-friendly interface designed to foster a sense of control and confidence. By embarking on this journey to 
create IHateMoney, we are not just developing software; we are catalyzing a movement towards financial liberation and 
empowerment.
